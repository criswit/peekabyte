## Description

Implement a draggable divider between split panes to allow users to adjust the relative size of each pane according to their needs

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Divider shows hover cursor on mouse over
- [ ] Dragging divider resizes adjacent panes
- [ ] Pane sizes update smoothly during drag
- [ ] Double-click on divider resets to 50/50 split
- [ ] Divider position persists in localStorage
- [ ] Minimum/maximum constraints prevent extreme sizes
